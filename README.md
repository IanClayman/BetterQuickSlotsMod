# BetterQuickSlotsMod

## What Is It?
Better Quick Slots is a mod that does exactly what the name says: it gives you better quick slots.  Installing this mod will give you the benefit of a second quick slot bar where you can assign skills and
items just like you normally would, doubling the total number of available quick slots from eight to sixteen.

Switching between the quick slot bars is as easy as setting up a keybinding using the in-game menus - no editing of .config files required!  Both keyboards and controllers are fully supported, and switching between
bars causes no lag or stuttering of any kind.

## Currently-Implemented Features
- Two quick slot bars with eight quick slots each for a total of 16 assignable quick slots
- In-game assignment of keybindings

## Yet-To-Be-Implemented Features
- Non-destructive implementation: future releases of Better Quick Slots will work seamlessly with other quick slot mods such as Extended Quickslots (https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/41)
	- Controller implementation will be locked to a maximum of eight quick slots onscreen at any one time due to built-in limitations in Outward, but you will be able to create as many quick slots as you'd like
		and cycle through as many sets of eight as you have assigned.  In keyboard mode the only limit will be how many slots can fit on your screen!
- Set display: sets of quick slots will be named, allowing you to tell at a glance what set you are currently using
- Custom set naming: Once the displaying of set names is implemented I will try to allow custom naming of sets (for example, you'll be able to have one set called "Ranged Skills" and another called "Melee Skills)

## How To Install
